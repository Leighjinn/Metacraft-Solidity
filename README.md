contract MyToken
>This is a smart contract representing a token on the blockchain.

mapping
>The contract likely includes a mapping data structure to keep track of token balances for each address. This mapping might look like mapping(address => uint256) balances;, where the keys are addresses and the values are the corresponding token balances.

function mint
>This function is responsible for creating new tokens and assigning them to a specific address. It typically takes parameters such as the address to mint tokens for and the amount of tokens to mint. After minting, it increases the total token supply and adds the minted tokens to the balance of the specified address.

function burn
>This function is used to destroy tokens by removing them from circulation. It likely takes parameters such as the address from which to burn tokens and the amount of tokens to burn. It checks if the specified address has sufficient balance to burn the specified amount, then decreases the total token supply and deducts the burned tokens from the balance of the specified address.
